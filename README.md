# What is Sensible?
A small tool that provides monitoring for your Linux server via Home Assistant sensors and MQTT discovery.

*Note*: Yes, it's probably a temporary name, but I wanted to have something that at least a bit makes sense... (Pun intended!)

# How it works?

It does stuff - obviously this needs to be updated :)

# How to use it?

TBD

# Building Sensible

TBD

# Development and planned features

 * Sensors that take CLI output should be configured as plugins without the need to rebuild them
 * There should be a way to implement sensors in Go for fully customized sensor data
 * Authentication for the API and a way to disable it
 * Dockerfile 
 * Configuration via environment variables
 
# Doc sections fully missing (besides the above ones)

 * docker-compose example
 * Systemd service file example
 * Example usage for LCX containers
 * Configuration example (settings.yaml)
